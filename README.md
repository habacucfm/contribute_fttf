# Submission guidelines

### Essential information
It is essential that in your submission at least include the information below (if you prefer to fill-in some templates follow this [link](./templates/templates.md)):


-   Data file: It must include a column with a scientific name (genus, genus and species epithet) for each entry (row), and a column for each other variable included. See an example [here](https://github.com/habacucfm/contribute_fttf/blob/master/templates/templates.md#data-file-template).

-   Units for each variable included in your data file: International system units are preferred. (i.e. g, kg, bp, etc) OR you can fill in the dataMatchColumns.csv file, see [here](https://github.com/habacucfm/contribute_fttf/blob/master/templates/templates.md#template-for-datamatchcolumnscsv) .

-   Essential metadata: “experiment_type” whether the data was collected in the lab, field, data compilation; “tissue_type” (did you measure sporocarps, mycelium, fruiting bodies?). Don’t really know what to include? See this [file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/habacucfm/contribute_fttf/master/templates/studyMetadata.csv) for some inspiration.

-   Reference for your study OR .bib file: Not published yet? Not a problem! Grab this [template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/habacucfm/contribute_fttf/master/templates/studyRef.bib) and fill in as much information as you can! We will update this information as studies get published. Just let us know.

-   Contact information: Please give us a name, email address and physical address for the main contact person in your study.


**Note that comma-separated files (.csv) are the preferred format for these files.**
